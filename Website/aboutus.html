	<p>Fake News is a long standing phenomenon cositsting of information that has the malicious intent to decieve its readers under the guise of being authentic. Recently with the 2016 US presedential election, fake news has taken the spotlight and gained a lot of media attention.</p>

	<p>Fake news websites have changed from looking very unprofessional and mainly for the use of satire, to looking very professional with a serious intent and ability to decieve. Distinguishing between fake news and real news is harder than ever. It is clear that fact checking is now of the upmost importance</p>

	<p>We believe in transparancey when it comes to distinguishing fake news. Without an open source project a fake news finder is open to all sort of bias from the creators. Every attempt to make this project unbiased has been taken.</p></center>
